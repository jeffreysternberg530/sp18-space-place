## Course Description 

What is the “spatial turn” and how does it intersect with the digital humanities? This course offers an introduction to major theories of space and place and how they are being applied through technologies such as Geographic Information Systems (GIS), data visualizations, and 3D modeling. This is a hands-on course in which students will develop digital skillsets, including creating online maps and visualizations, analyzing spatial datasets, and designing virtual exhibits - all within a humanities framework of spatial theory. Classes will consist of a combination of discussion, practicums, walking tours, and field trips. Students will emerge from the course with spatial literacy: the ability to critically read, analyze, and interpret a wide variety of spaces and places (neighborhoods, landscapes, museums) along with ways of representing these geographies in maps, narratives, video games, and other media.

## Learning Goals

- **Theory**: An overview of major theories of space and place
